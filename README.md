# CS201-Project
This is the final project for the course CS201

CS201 group-35

We have implemented the program for the construction of a suffix tree from a given input in the form of a string.
We have used the famous Ukonnen's Algorithm for the construction, which does the same in O(N) time. We have also 
implemented one application of the suffix tree, that is printing the linear time suffix array based on the suffix
tree. 
In the program, the user will be asked to input a string of his or her choice. The program will then create a suffix
tree based on the input and output the content on the edges of the tree (in the form of suffixes), and also the number 
of nodes present in the tree. Thereafter the program will print the linear time suffix array for the input string.
This marks the end of the program.
